         <p>This is the cusom build gaming handheld I built. 
            It consists of many difernt parts both manufactured and custom, the whole chasis is 3d printed and custom designed to fit all the components as needed
            I used mostly commercial parts that you can find fairly easily online like a raspberry pi 3, 5" hdmi display and a teensy lc micro controller, But some parts i had to design from scratch
            the circuit boards that the consoles controls are on are completly custom and meant to make assembly easier for the future if i wanted to make modifafactions.
            It runs on 2 18650 lithium ploymer batteries which are very common batterys used in many electroics from laptop batterys to vaporizers and it runs an operating system called retropie.
            The os come packed with many differnt emulators and plugins meant to make using the pi for retro emulation easy, it's also at its core a linux computer so you can use it for more than just games.
